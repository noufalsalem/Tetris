# Tetris
Run of the mill 2D Tetris game I did for fun a long while back - as it's one of my favorite classic arcade games. 

I eventually touched it up to add two logos in the game body's background: a university logo as well as a logo for the Google Developers Students Club that I was in just to showcase a simple task to a group of students in a student workshop I was giving.
